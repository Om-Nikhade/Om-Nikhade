## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience building scalable web applications using **Java (Spring Boot), React.js, REST APIs**, and modern DevOps tools like **Jenkins, Docker, AWS, and Git**.

🔧 I enjoy crafting efficient backend systems and clean, responsive frontends — and I love automating deployment pipelines that make life easier for dev teams.

💡 Currently pursuing my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** from SPPU, I’m open to full-time opportunities, internships, or collaborations on open-source and impactful tech projects.
